Designed for use with Borland Delphi 5, 6, 7, 2005/Win32, 2006/Win32, Turbo Delphi, CodeGear Delphi 2007, CodeGear Delphi 2009 and Embarcadero Delphi 2010.

This aims to supply a Borland Delphi translation of Alan Miller's Random Module for FORTRAN-90. This translation has been done with Dr Miller's approval and is being made FREELY available to all Delphi Developers, though we do ask the Alan Miller and ESB Consultancy be given due credit.

The following Random Number Generators:

- Normal (Gaussian)
- Gamma
- Chi-squared
- Exponential
- Weibull
- Beta
- t
- Multivariate Normal
- Generalized inverse Gaussian
- Binomial (2 different ones)
- Negative Binomial
- von Mises
- Cauchy

The free MRNG.PAS from EFD Systems no longer seems to be available, so we have included it in the Zip. Please continue to give credit to EFD Systems.

Alan Miller has also given us permission to include our translation in our ESBPCS Shareware - see:

http://www.esbconsult.com/esbpcs

and that will allow us to make use of some of our enhanced features there. ESB Consultancy is dedicated to maintaining this free version as well as the one that eventually resides in ESBPCS.

Also to rebuild the Tester then ESBPCS for VCL, TeeChart and MRNG are needed - have included the source for interest mainly.
